# [Animation Fill Code](http://animationfillcode.com)

A web app that lets you paste your working WebKit or Mozilla keyframe animation code and then output the rest of the necessary code, including the standard syntax.

Currently, the app requires that you use working code that has either -webkit- or -moz- prefixes, and you must specify via a radio button which one you're entering (i.e., it won't auto-detect).
